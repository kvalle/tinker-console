## Project Description

The **Tinker Console** is an interactive, play-focused control panel designed for children, inspired by factory dashboards, rocket launch consoles, and audio mixing boards. Built around an ESP8266 NodeMCU, the panel features multiple buttons, a potentiometer, a strip of nine Neopixel LEDs, and two buzzers.

The main goal is to spark curiosity and give the child something tactile to play with. When the child presses a button, turns the knob, or triggers any input, the console responds with colorful lighting effects and simple sounds, creating an engaging “cause-and-effect” experience.
